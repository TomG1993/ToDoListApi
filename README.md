ToDoListApi

• How long did you spend on your solution? 

6+~ hours, longer than asked but I was quite enjoying it.

• How do you build and run your solution? 

The API can be run out of visual studio and I use NPM Start for the React. The react solution contains a guide.

• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing
your solution? 

I assumed there will be a place to host an API and a way to deliver a standalone react front end. 

• Briefly explain your technical design and why do you think is the best
approach to this problem.

.NET Core API's are easily deployed and maintained within a microsoft stack, React is a intuitive modern front end.

• If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would
you have liked to implement them.

I was unable to separate the todos into groupings for Completed and Pending status


I have not implemented any unit tests due to already over running on time, I would have used some project style unit testing within Visual Studio such as xUnit.

I did not spend any time with the CSS in this solution so the design is very basic.
